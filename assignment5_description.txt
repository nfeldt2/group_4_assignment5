Truck (Nathan): This class animated a truck that raced against the other cars. The truck had two layers of animation. First the truck would move from left to right or right to left. This was accomplished by using lerp functions. If the truck was less than halfway up the screen the truck would randomly lerp from 150 to 650 pixels forward however if the truck was more than halfway through the screen the truck would randomly lerp backward 150 to 500 pixels backward. The second leyer of animation was the tires. The tires where made using sin and cos functions to a cylinder. These tires where rotated every frame. The speed of the rotation was determined by if the truck was speeding up or the truck was slowing down (with respect to the other cars). If the truck was speeding up the tires would increase rotation but if the truck was slowing down then the tires would decrease rotation. Everything was implemented to this class that I planned to except for the exhaust. I could not figure out how to change its angle based on the trucks speed, in addition it caused lots of lag.
