Truck (Nathan): This class animated a truck that raced against the other cars. The truck had two layers of animation. First the truck would move from left to right or right to left (with respect to the camera). This was done to make it look like it was competing with the other cars. This was accomplished by using a lerp function. If the truck was less than halfway up the screen the truck would randomly lerp from 150 to 650 pixels forward however if the truck was more than halfway through the screen the truck would randomly lerp backward 150 to 500 pixels backward. The second layer of animation was the tires. The tires where made using sin and cos functions to from a cylinder by iterating over a for loop. These tires where rotated every frame. The speed of the rotation was determined by if the truck was speeding up or the truck was slowing down (with respect to the other cars). If the truck was speeding up the tires would increase rotation but if the truck was slowing down then the tires would decrease rotation. Everything was implemented to this class that I planned to except for the exhaust. I could not figure out how to change its angle based on the trucks speed, in addition it caused lots of lag. 

Tricycle (Jaden): This class animates a 3-wheeled vehicle moving in a circular fashion. It accomplishes this by rotating the vehicle and its components about the y-axis. The second animation is the rotation of the vehicle's tires. The tires rotate forward with the motion. The class was implemented as expected other than the tire skid marks. I was unable to leave a tire trail along the x-z plane as intended. In my best case scenario, the vehicle left an infinite number of tires along the path of its motion.
